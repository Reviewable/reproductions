Overview
When embedding a Google Doc in Github, all seems to work fine. Link works.
When this PR is opened in Reviewable, when you enter the link, access is denied.
Since the actual link is identical, I can only assume this is some referrer issue.

Scenarios
This happens when the link is either in the body of the PR on as a comment.
This happens when link is (MD) embedded as well as just inserted as text.
